# TypeScript Practice Repository

This is my TypeScript Practice Repository — a comprehensive, hands-on collection of TypeScript examples and exercises.  
This repository is organized into topics, each containing two folders:

- **start/** – initial setup for practicing the topic.
- **final/** – completed version for reference.

---

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to provide a structured way to learn TypeScript by writing practical code.  
It covers fundamental and advanced TypeScript concepts step by step, from the basics to more complex features such as decorators and namespaces.

## What is TypeScript?

**TypeScript** is a **typed superset of JavaScript** developed by Microsoft. It adds optional static typing and modern language features that help developers catch errors early, write cleaner code, and maintain large codebases more effectively.

In simpler terms:

**TypeScript = JavaScript + Type Safety + Better Developer Experience**

### Key Benefits

- Detects errors during compile time rather than runtime.
- Provides a strong type system for predictable, maintainable code.
- Enhances productivity through IntelliSense and autocompletion.
- Works seamlessly with existing JavaScript projects.
- Supports modern ES6+ JavaScript features.

## Repository Overview

This repository is divided into eight main sections. Each section focuses on a core TypeScript topic and includes both a `start/` and a `final/` implementation.

| No. | Topic | Description |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| 01 | TypeScript Basics & Data Types | Learn about basic data types, arrays, objects, and type inference. |
| 02 | Compiler Configuration | Explore `tsconfig.json`, compiler options, and project organization. |
| 03 | Advanced ES6 Features | Practice modern JavaScript (ES6+) features with TypeScript, such as arrow functions and modules. |
| 04 | Classes and Functions | Understand classes, inheritance, access modifiers, and method overloading. |
| 05 | Advanced Types | Learn advanced type concepts like unions, intersections, generics, and type aliases. |
| 06 | Expense Tracker Project | Build a small real-world project to apply TypeScript concepts in practice. |
| 07 | Decorators | Explore how decorators enhance class and method behavior. |
| 08 | Namespaces | Learn to organize large TypeScript codebases using namespaces. |
